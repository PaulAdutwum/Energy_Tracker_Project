        <h2>Welcome to the Energy Tracker Dashboard!</h2>
        <p>
            This dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into energy consumption patterns across dorms at Bates College. Using a combination of real-world inspired data and advanced analytics, this platform empowers users to explore, analyze, and understand how energy is utilized over time.
        </p>
        <h3>What the Data Represents:</h3>
        <p>
            The data encompasses hourly energy usage recorded over a five-year span (2018-2023) across various dormitories. Factors such as seasons, appliance types, hours of the day, and holidays have been simulated to reflect realistic usage trends. 
            Additionally, anomalies and occasional spikes have been incorporated to simulate real-world unpredictability and to facilitate anomaly detection.
        </p>
        <h3>Machine Learning Integration:</h3>
        <p>
            A machine learning regression model is employed to predict energy consumption patterns. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> The data is preprocessed to include meaningful attributes such as time of day, season, dorm, and appliance type.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Training and Testing:</strong> A portion of the data is used to train the model, while the rest is reserved for testing and validating its accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Insights and Predictions:</strong> The model identifies patterns and predicts energy usage for different dorms and time periods. These predictions can help identify potential overuse, optimize energy distribution, and suggest improvements for energy efficiency.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Features of the Dashboard:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Usage Summary:</strong> A dorm-wise breakdown of total energy consumption, highlighting which dorms consume the most energy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Visualizations:</strong> Interactive charts and graphs that illustrate trends in energy usage across seasons, hours, and appliances.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Machine Learning Insights:</strong> Predictions and analyses derived from advanced algorithms to forecast energy consumption and identify unusual patterns.
            </li>
        </ul>
