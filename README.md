# Energy Tracker Project

This project tracks energy usage across different dorms at Bates College, providing insights into energy consumption patterns and enabling predictive analysis using machine learning.

## Features
-  Energy Data: Uses energy usage data for dormitories and appliances, considering seasonal variations, peak usage hours, and weather impacts.
- Data Visualization: Provides graphs and charts for energy usage trends by dorm and over time.
- Machine Learning Integration**: Includes regression models for predicting energy consumption.
- Web Dashboard (Future): Plans to develop a user-friendly dashboard using Flask or Django for visualization and insights.
